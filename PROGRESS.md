## ðŸš§ TODO Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Minecraft protocol implementation
- [ ] Packet parsing and sending
- [ ] Actual game integration (key sending, mouse control)
- [ ] World state management
- [ ] Entity tracking and updates

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Anti-cheat evasion techniques
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Logging system

### Low Priority
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Advanced statistics
- [ ] Multi-server support
- [ ] Replay system

## ðŸ”§ Technical Debt
- [ ] Replace placeholder implementations with real ones
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout
- [ ] Implement missing method bodies
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Memory leak detection and fixing
- [ ] Thread safety improvements

## ðŸ“‹ Build Status
- [ ] Compiles without errors
- [ ] Links successfully
- [ ] Runs without crashing
- [ ] Connects to Minecraft servers
- [ ] Performs basic bot functions

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Implement basic Minecraft protocol handling
2. Add real key/mouse input injection
3. Create world state synchronization
4. Test with actual Minecraft server
5. Performance profiling and optimization
